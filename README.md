# YuGiOh! Master Duel - D. D. Dynamite Bot

I'm open-sourcing part of the script for my D. D. Dynamite Bot now that D. D. Dynamite is limited and the script is entirely useless. This is for educational purposes, to expand on why bots are only able to play simple decks. As you can see, even the code for a single turn of YuGiOh! Master Duel can take thousands of lines of code to implement. In a game with over 10,000 cards the number of interactions possible render it virtually impossible to make a bot that can play as well as a human. Because of this, the most likely targets for my next script is either an Igknight FTK deck, or a Ruinforce FTK deck.
